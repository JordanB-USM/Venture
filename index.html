    <p class="tab">I've led with that for a strong 15 years. And, it has earned me more friends than I think a less genuine attention getter would have.</p>
    <p class="tab">I'm a amatuer mathematician and professional computer programmer. I've done a lot of work in C++ and Java, but my passions still hold firm to Python and that cruel mistress's strange faculties. I have experience in drone operation, penetration testing, automated testing, data processing, and I've done some particularly entertaining design work on meteorological applications with my late father, whose constant lifelong prodding with logic problems I blame for basically my entire personality. Thus, any complaints therein should be directed to an urn at my mother's home.</p>
    <p class="tab">I'm also a fan of a good macabre, dry humor. Dry as calcium dust with trace heavy metals! </p>
