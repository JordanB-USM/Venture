    <h2>Orange is my favorite color!</h2>
    <p class="tab">I've led with that for a strong 15 years. And, it has earned me more friends than I think a less genuine attention getter would have.</p>
    <p class="tab">I'm a amatuer mathematician and professional computer programmer. I've done a lot of work in C++ and Java, but my passions still hold firm to Python and that cruel mistress's strange faculties. 
                   I have experience in drone operation, penetration testing, automated testing, data processing, and I've done some particularly entertaining design work on meteorological applications with my late father, 
                   whose constant lifelong prodding with logic problems I blame for basically my entire personality. Thus, any complaints therein should be directed to an urn at my mother's home. I'm also a fan of a good 
                   macabre, dry humor. Dry as calcium dust with trace heavy metals! </p>
    <p class="tab">In addition to these facts, I am a freelance commision artist. I mostly work with plastic base water soluable paints, and I paint a great deal of miniatures and landscapes. I've been painting for almost 
                   ten years now; And, though I'm far from the best painter, I'm farther from the worst. It has been a long time since I've lived off of painting money; now'a'days I just charge materials and refuse to work 
                   on a timetable.</p>
    <p class="tab">I listen to a pretty good variety of music, and I've shared a few songs here. </p>
