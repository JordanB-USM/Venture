        <h3>University Projects of Note</h3>
	<h4 class="tab">Operating Systems Term Project</h4>
	<p class="extratab">Designed, programmed, and tested virtual register system simulating the prioritization of tasks
pending on a rudimentary processor as term project. System was designed to a set of assigned
requirements for performance and execution of the register system. Scope of the project across the
semester required development of well documented, reusable, and organized code. The project was
assigned in phases revealed as the semester progressed, and each phase of the project required reuse and
modification of previously developed work to encourage modular programming.</p>
	<h4 class="tab">Software Engineering 1 and 2</h4>
	<p class="extratab">Multiple term projects requiring the design, development, and execution of full programming
applications in small, self organized groups of students to overview and teach modern software
development techniques. Course work involved guided education about documentation and organization
of work and personnel within modern software development. Application development was managed
entirely by the student group, with regular presentations of work on each stage of the project to build a
familiarity with working in teams of other developers and the expectations of development cycles.
A broad number of programming languages and software environments were engaged over both
courses, and cross-functionality and diversification of responsibility within student groups was
mandatory.</p>
